# The effects of Present Bias on Migration Decision:
Insights from a Markov Decision Process Approach

Abstract:

The reasons for migration decision are extremely complex. Classical models of mi-
gration reason that these decisions are driven by push-pull mechanisms. However,
these models often fail to explain why two seemingly identical individuals with sim-
ilar push and pull factors may produce differing migration behaviours. To address
this discrepancy, we turn to behavioural economics for insight. In this paper, I
develop a dynamic micro-migration choice model in which present-biased agents
attempt to solve their migration decision problems under uncertainty. This model
expands on previous approaches by incorporating repeated migration decisions, ac-
counting for failed migration attempts, and introducing present bias through hy-
perbolic discounting. Utilizing computational methods, I demonstrate that when
migration costs are considered, the probability of migration decreases with present
bias for agents with identical observable characteristics.
